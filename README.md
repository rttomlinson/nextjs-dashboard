States of a bet

1. First the bet is 'placed' if it is determined to be an acceptable bet. Acceptable is not yet defined here

2. At some point, the bet will go into 'pending' status. Could be 12 hours before the bet expiration?
   Something akin to "cannot make changes to bet any longer". We are now waiting for events to determine if the bet has be won or lost. 1 or more events

3. When all the event criteria has been determined or the designated waiting period for results has passed, we now determine if
   all the criteria has been met. If so, then we can mark as 'won' and if not, we mark as lost

4. Just because the bet has been won or lost, doesn't mean that funds are been transfered yet. We want another attribute that
   falls along the lines of 'settled' or 'reconciled'. This tells the user and the platform that we are at the end of the bet lifecycle

# Auth0 Next.js SDK Sample Application

This sample demonstrates the integration of [Auth0 Next.js SDK](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0) into a Next.js application created using [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app). The sample is a companion to the [Auth0 Next.js SDK Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs).

This sample demonstrates the following use cases:

- [Login](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/components/NavBar.jsx#L61-L67)
- [Logout](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/components/NavBar.jsx#L93-L95)
- [Showing the user profile](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/pages/profile.jsx)
- [Protecting client-side rendered pages](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/pages/profile.jsx#L43-L46)
- [Calling APIs](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/pages/external.jsx)

## Project setup

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

### Create an API

For the **External API** page to work, you will need to [create an API](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/apis) using the [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis). This will give you an API Identifier that you can use in the `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` environment variable below. Then you will need to [add a permission](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/dashboard/add-api-permissions) named `read:shows` to your API. To get your app to ask for that permission, include it in the value of the `AUTH0_SCOPE` environment variable.

If you do not wish to use an API or observe the API call working, you should not specify the `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` and `AUTH0_SCOPE` values in the next steps.

### Configure credentials

The project needs to be configured with your Auth0 Domain, Client ID and Client Secret for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, first copy `.env.local.example` into a new file in the same folder called `.env.local`, and replace the values with your own Auth0 application credentials (see more info about [loading environmental variables in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables)):

```sh
# A long secret value used to encrypt the session cookie
AUTH0_SECRET='LONG_RANDOM_VALUE'
# The base url of your application
AUTH0_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'
# The url of your Auth0 tenant domain
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL='https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN.auth0.com'
# Your Auth0 application's Client ID
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID'
# Your Auth0 application's Client Secret
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET'
# Your Auth0 API's Identifier
# OMIT if you do not want to use the API part of the sample
AUTH0_AUDIENCE='YOUR_AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER'
# The permissions your app is asking for
# OMIT if you do not want to use the API part of the sample
AUTH0_SCOPE='openid profile email read:shows'
```

**Note**: Make sure you replace `AUTH0_SECRET` with your own secret (you can generate a suitable string using `openssl rand -hex 32` on the command line).

## Run the sample

### Compile and hot-reload for development

This compiles and serves the Next.js app and starts the API server on port 3001.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker build

To build and run the Docker image, run `exec.sh`, or `exec.ps1` on Windows.

### Run the unit tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Run the integration tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).

## Create a Free Auth0 Account
